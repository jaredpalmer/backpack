# Custom Webpack Configuration With Typescript Example

## How to use

Download the example (or clone the whole project)[https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack.git]:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/palmerhq/backpack/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 backpack-master/examples/with-typescript
cd with-typescript
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Idea behind the example

This demonstrates how to customize the underlying Webpack 2 configuration in a Backpack project using a `backpack.config.js` file.
The app itself is exactly the same project as the Webpack configuration example. However, the express application is written in TypeScript.
